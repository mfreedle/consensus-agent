# Multi-Provider Tool Integration Plan

## Current Status
‚úÖ **OpenAI**: Responses API with built-in tools implemented
‚ö†Ô∏è **Other Providers**: Basic chat completion only

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### 1. Enhanced Grok Integration
- Add web search capabilities (built-in to Grok)
- Implement custom function calling for Google Drive tools
- Add image generation support (Aurora model)

### 2. Anthropic Claude Integration  
- Add computer use capabilities (beta)
- Implement built-in tool support (bash, text editor, web search)
- Add custom function calling

### 3. Provider-Specific Method Architecture
```python
# Proposed method structure
async def get_openai_response_with_builtin_tools()  # ‚úÖ Done
async def get_grok_response_with_tools()           # üìã To implement  
async def get_claude_response_with_tools()         # üìã To implement
async def get_generic_response()                   # ‚úÖ Fallback exists
```

### 4. Benefits of Multi-Provider Tool Support
- **Grok**: Real-time web search, social media integration, image generation
- **Claude**: Computer automation, advanced reasoning with tools
- **OpenAI**: Comprehensive built-in tool ecosystem
- **Better User Experience**: Each model can leverage its unique strengths

### 5. Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Grok web search + function calling
2. **Medium Priority**: Claude computer use + built-in tools  
3. **Low Priority**: Other providers as needed

## Technical Requirements
- Each provider needs its own tool implementation
- Unified interface for tool results
- Provider detection logic for appropriate tool routing
- Fallback mechanisms for unsupported tools

---
**Conclusion**: Each provider has unique tool capabilities that should be implemented separately for optimal performance rather than trying to share tools across APIs.
