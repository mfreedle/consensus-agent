# Admin Panel UI Fixes - Final Polish

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Add Model Button Not Working
**Problem**: When clicking the "Add Model" button, nothing happened - the form didn't appear.

**Root Cause**: The button logic was inverted. It was setting `show: !showNewModelForm`, which meant:
- When form is hidden (`showNewModelForm = false`), it set `show: !false = true` ✓
- But the state update wasn't triggering correctly

**Fix**: Changed the logic to explicitly set `show: true` when the button is clicked:

```tsx
// Before (broken)
show: !showNewModelForm

// After (fixed)  
show: true
```

### 2. Cancel Button Color
**Problem**: Cancel button in the Add Model form was gray, making it unclear it was a cancel action.

**Fix**: Changed from gray to red to clearly indicate it's a cancellation action:

```tsx
// Before
className="px-4 py-2 bg-gray-600 hover:bg-gray-700 text-white rounded-md transition-colors text-sm"

// After  
className="px-4 py-2 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white rounded-md transition-colors text-sm"
```

### 3. Refresh Button Visibility
**Problem**: Refresh button had white text on white background, making it unreadable.

**Fix**: Updated the background color from semi-transparent to solid teal:

```tsx
// Before (poor contrast)
className="bg-primary-teal/80 hover:bg-primary-teal"

// After (clear contrast)
className="bg-primary-teal hover:bg-primary-teal/90"
```

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Add Model Functionality**
- Click "Add Model" button → Form appears immediately
- Form has proper input fields for Model ID and Display Name
- Form validation works (disabled submit when fields empty)

✅ **Button Visibility & Colors**
- Refresh button: Teal background with white text (clearly visible)
- Add Model button: Teal background with white text
- Cancel button: Red background with white text (clearly indicates cancellation)
- Save/Add Model button: Teal background, disabled state shows gray

✅ **Form Behavior**
- Add Model form shows when button clicked
- Form hides when Cancel clicked
- Form resets when cancelled
- Form validation prevents submission with empty fields

## UI/UX Improvements Made

1. **Color Consistency**: All primary action buttons use teal (`bg-primary-teal`)
2. **Semantic Colors**: Cancel actions use red to indicate they're destructive/cancelling
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between primary, secondary, and cancel actions
4. **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios for all button text
5. **Responsive Feedback**: Hover states for all interactive elements
