# Enhanced Markdown Rendering Test

This file demonstrates the improved markdown formatting now available in your Consensus Agent chat interface.

## Features Improved

### 1. **Better Typography and Spacing**
- Enhanced paragraph spacing for better readability
- Improved line height (1.7) for easier scanning
- Better header hierarchy with visual separation

### 2. **Enhanced Lists**
The lists now have better spacing:

#### Bullet Points:
- First item with good spacing
- Second item with proper indentation
- Third item showing nested lists:
  - Nested item 1
  - Nested item 2
  - Another level:
    - Deep nested item

#### Numbered Lists:
1. **Primary feature** - Enhanced markdown rendering
2. **Secondary feature** - Better code block styling
3. **Tertiary feature** - Improved table formatting

### 3. **Code Examples**

#### Inline Code
You can now use `inline code` that looks much better with proper styling and background.

#### Code Blocks
```javascript
// JavaScript example with syntax highlighting support
function enhanceChat(message) {
  const formatted = ReactMarkdown({
    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
    components: {
      // Enhanced components
    }
  });
  return formatted;
}
```

```python
# Python example
def improve_formatting():
    """Enhance the chat message formatting."""
    styles = {
        'headers': 'Better hierarchy',
        'lists': 'Improved spacing',
        'code': 'Enhanced styling'
    }
    return styles
```

### 4. **Enhanced Blockquotes**

> This is an important note that stands out with the new blockquote styling.
> It has a teal border and subtle background for better visibility.

> **Pro Tip:** The new styling makes important information much more noticeable and easier to read.

### 5. **Table Support**
