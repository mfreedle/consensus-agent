DALL-E Routing Fix Summary
==========================

## Problem
- When users tried to use OpenAI DALL-E 3 for image generation, they received a Grok API error
- The error was: "Grok API error about DALL-E 3" - indicating the request was being routed to Grok instead of OpenAI

## Root Cause
1. The orchestrator.py file had no dedicated method for OpenAI image generation 
2. The chat/router.py file had no routing logic for DALL-E models (dall-e-3, dall-e-2)
3. DALL-E requests were falling through to the "unknown provider" fallback, which used Grok

## Solution
1. **Added generate_openai_image() method to orchestrator.py**:
   - Handles OpenAI DALL-E image generation properly
   - Uses the OpenAI images.generate() API
   - Supports proper size and quality parameters with literal type checking
   - Returns images in base64 format for embedding in responses
   - Includes proper error handling for OpenAI image API

2. **Updated chat/router.py routing logic**:
   - Added explicit routing for models that start with "dall-e"
   - Routes them to the new generate_openai_image() method
   - Placed before the Grok routing to ensure proper precedence

## Changes Made
- File: backend/app/llm/orchestrator.py
  - Added: async def generate_openai_image() method (lines ~1569-1647)
  
- File: backend/app/chat/router.py  
  - Added: elif model.startswith("dall-e"): routing logic (lines ~271-275)

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- When a user selects DALL-E 3 or DALL-E 2 model and asks for image generation
- The request will be routed to OpenAI's image generation API (not Grok)
- Images will be generated successfully and displayed in the chat interface
- No more "Grok API error about DALL-E 3" messages

## Test Instructions
1. Deploy the updated backend code
2. Select "dall-e-3" model in the frontend model picker
3. Send a message like: "Generate an image of a sunset over mountains"
4. Verify the response comes from OpenAI image generation (not Grok error)
5. Verify the generated image displays properly in the chat interface
