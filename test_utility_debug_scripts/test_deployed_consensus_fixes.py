# Manual Testing Checklist for Consensus Engine Fixes

## 🌐 Deployed App URL
{DEPLOYED_APP_URL}

## ✅ Pre-Test Setup
- [ ] App loads successfully
- [ ] Can login with credentials (admin/admin)
- [ ] Chat interface is visible
- [ ] Model selection controls are present

## 🎯 Consensus Engine Tests

### Single Model Selection
- [ ] Select only ONE model (e.g., GPT-4)
- [ ] Send a test message: "What is 2+2?"
- [ ] Verify: Response comes quickly (no consensus delay)
- [ ] Verify: No "thinking" indicator appears
- [ ] Check browser console: Should show `use_consensus: false`

### Multiple Model Selection  
- [ ] Select TWO OR MORE models (e.g., GPT-4 + Grok)
- [ ] Send a test message: "Explain artificial intelligence"
- [ ] Verify: "Thinking" indicator appears with phases:
  - [ ] "Analyzing..." 
  - [ ] "Processing..."
  - [ ] "Consensus..."
  - [ ] "Finalizing..."
- [ ] Verify: Response takes longer (consensus processing)
- [ ] Check browser console: Should show `use_consensus: true`

### Message Routing
- [ ] Create a new chat session
- [ ] Send a message
- [ ] Switch to different session while waiting for response
- [ ] Verify: Response appears in correct session
- [ ] Switch back to original session
- [ ] Verify: Message and response are still there

### Socket.IO Connection
- [ ] Check browser console for Socket.IO connection logs
- [ ] Look for: "Socket.IO connected" message
- [ ] Verify: Real-time updates work (messages appear instantly)

## 🐛 Error Scenarios
- [ ] Test with no model selected
- [ ] Test with invalid session switching
- [ ] Test message sending when disconnected

## 📊 Performance Check
- [ ] Single model responses: Should be fast (~2-5 seconds)
- [ ] Multi-model responses: Should show consensus phases (~10-15 seconds)
- [ ] UI should remain responsive during processing

## ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] Single model bypasses consensus ✓
- [ ] Multiple models use consensus ✓  
- [ ] Thinking indicator shows for consensus ✓
- [ ] Messages route to correct session ✓
- [ ] Changes are visible in deployed app ✓
